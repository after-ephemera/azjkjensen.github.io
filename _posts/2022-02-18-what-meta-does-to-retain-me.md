(thoughts are my own and not representative of those of my employer)

Lots of people have described this topic more eloquently than I can. Nothing in this post will merit a NYT article and nothing, really, will be groundbreaking. But a recent blog post by a friend about [why he left](https://chalcidfly.repl.co/posts/retain/){:target="blank"} gave me pause â€“ why do I stay here instead of finding the next great thing? If my resume is any indication, I'm not afraid to jump ship when a big opportunity presents itself; I have wondered time and again if I'm flakey or distractable or if I just don't have the grit to stick it out through hard things. But here I am three years later and still enamored with my work. 

I was hired by Facebook (now Meta) in 2019 as a Production Engineer to build software systems that are [reliable, scalable, secure, and efficient](https://engineering.fb.com/category/production-engineering/){:target="blank"}. I've been here for almost three years and I'm not planning on leaving soon, despite that [many would probably start looking at new opportunities by now](https://www.inc.com/business-insider/tech-companies-employee-turnover-average-tenure-silicon-valley.html){:target="blank"}. The company offers me what I need to stick around.

Every place I've worked has offered different things, but for me, Meta is special. Why? 

## the people are incredible

The people at this company actually believe in the mission of bringing the world closer together. They recognize and embrace the huge responsibility it puts on us. 

Working previously on AR/VR and now in Privacy, I have seen people at various levels of the company fight for the interests and safety of the billions of people who use our services, do the right thing at the cost of their reputation and the ever-pervasive (and powerful!) "move fast" culture, and build meaningful products that peoples' livelihood is based on. My anecdotal experience is limited, but I'm pretty sure these things are rare.

The nature of my work lets me ride the coattails of some of the best engineering leaders in the world. Listening to Michael Abrash's vision for the future of augmented and virtual reality gave me a deeper respect for the Xerox PARC folks who invented personal computing. Seeing people embrace that vision gave me confidence that the world will reinvent it again. My immediate and skip-level managers know how to build teams that get stuff done. The engineers on my teams have serious experience running distributed systems. Working with these people is exciting!

I do miss meeting in person. I have been "in office" on and off throughought the pandemic due to needing physical access on my first team and opting into it on my second team. Some of my team is in the office during the week, so I appreciate the time together. The "aura of magic" that used to permeate the Menlo Park campus that once belonged to Sun Microsystems is just beginning to return though. The tens of thousands of people who joined the company since the pandemic started probably don't feel that magic in the same way I did as a wide-eyed intern in 2018. I'm still crossing my fingers that it returns to its full glory, but time (and COVID) will tell.

I've been at the company longer than almost 70% of people, and we successfully keep hiring people like this! 

## the scale is unimaginable

The work I do matters and affects peoples' lives around the world. 

## the combination of autonomy and comfort is unmatched
- Traditional engineering companies get bogged down and may offer autonomy but don't value their employees the same.
- Non-tech companies may offer comfort to get you to join but growth is stunted.
- Startups offer unprecedented levels of autonomy, but at the cost of significant risk to your future, higher-than-acceptable stress levels.
## the company treats me like a rockstar
- pay, food, perks, travel, free gear, parties and events
- IVF + heart surgery

## reasons I could leave
- PR
- it's not cool
- pay raise

## when will I leave?
