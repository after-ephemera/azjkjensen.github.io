      <description>Every day in the month of May I conducted recorded interviews with my parents. We faced a host of technical difficulties and sometimes I lost several minutes&amp;rsquo; worth of precious recording because of them. Here are some interesting lessons I learned.

After every setback it is easy to see, in retrospect, the difficulty I was faced with. I recognize that my life has been for the most part one full of privilege â€“ I am grateful and undeserving of the life given me.</description>
