&lt;h1 id="android-architecture"&gt;android architecture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand mobile security one must become familiar with the mobile platform itself.

people like &lt;a href=""&gt;Stephen Hawking&lt;/a&gt;{:target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;}. His life was his craft, and he was and continues to be richly rewarded for persistence and intelligence. Hawking left behind a legacy that is simultaneously unbelievable and inspiring. But in today&amp;rsquo;s world the odds are against you achieving hyper-success by one-track-mindedness.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
