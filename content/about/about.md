_my name is Jk and i build systems._

### this blog

the best people i know write. technical skills only get you so far. i have bigger ambitions.

### about me

i'm currently building production systems at <a href="https://mystenlabs.com" target="_blank">mysten labs</a>.

i was a production engineer at meta for a few years, working on privacy infrastructure and AR/VR. before that, i was at Arizona State University in <a href="http://meteor.ame.asu.edu" target="_blank">meteor studio</a> working on new research in augmented reality security and privacy.

i know software will define much of the future of humanity, and my strongest desire is to leave a legacy my family can be proud of. outside of work i read and bake.

### reach out

i can be reached fairly easily at all the usual places like <a href="https://twitter.com/after_ephemera" target="_blank">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lovedonesandzeros" target="_blank">messenger</a>.
