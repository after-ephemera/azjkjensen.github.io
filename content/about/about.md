_my name is Jk and i build systems._

THIS SECTION IS A WIP AND IS PRESENTED AS-IS WITH NO GUARANTEES

### this blog

the best people i know write. technical skills only get you so far. i have bigger ambitions.

posts here are usually about the future of technology, building infrastructure systems, and privacy.

### about me

i work at the intersection of emerging technology and software, with an emphasis on infrastructure, privacy, and AR/VR.

i'm currently building production systems at <a href="https://mystenlabs.com" target="_blank">mysten labs</a>. i work on [zklogin](https://blog.sui.io/zklogin-salt-server-architecture/), the most widely used zero knowledge system on earth. i also [spoke on some of my work building reliable infrastructure fast at pulumi up 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQwpC02CQ9k)

i was a production engineer at meta for a few years, working on privacy infrastructure and AR/VR. before that, i was at Arizona State University in <a href="http://meteor.ame.asu.edu" target="_blank">meteor studio</a> working on new research in augmented reality security and privacy.

software will define the future of humanity, and my strongest desire is to leave a legacy of software i built that my family can be proud of.

### tidbits

- i love [strunk and white](https://archive.org/details/pdfy-2_qp8jQ61OI6NHwa) and treat it as a serious guidebook for life.
- i have a daughter who lights up my world. i subscribe to the [reggio emilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia_approach) approach the best i can in my parenting.
- rock and roll has always been a huge part of my life and recently i've gotten into a lot of metalcore. most \*core music contains themes and sounds i can enjoy.
- ergomech keyboards
- much like murakami, i began training for endurance athletics near the end of my twenties. i enjoy running long distance wherever i am and participate in the occasional race.
- when i was a teeenager i was an avid boy scout and earned the eagle scout award, taking many backpacking trips mostly around arizona. spending time in nature and making space for my family to do the same is a high priority for me.

priorities

- kindness

things

i generally try to live minimally and avoid accumulation of things when possible, prioritizing owning a few high-quality things.

- you will find me wearing mostly black most of the year. i thoroughly enjoy the variety of styles that exist within a single color. this is an outward expression of my belief that [constraint yields creativity](https://x.com/after_ephemera/status/1968102054750302227).
- i almost exclusively run long distance in [altras](https://www.altrarunning.com/en-us/all-shoes?gad_campaignid=21768670950&gbraid=0AAAAADm0swc4KpS9FqbleaF7gl-Rah52v). i am accustomed the luxury of running zero-drop and with a wide toebox. they are well worth the premium price.
- inside i wear my [mahabi curves](https://mahabis.com/products/curve-slippers), which provide a balance between comfort and support, especially working from home.
- i have a single [global chef knife](https://www.globalcutleryusa.com/chef-knife-7-5-40th-anniv-g-78-ab) that has treated me well but is showing signs of incessant use.
- [dunlop tortex jazz iii ](https://www.jimdunlop.com/jazz-iii-pick-variety-pack-6-pack/) have been my chosen guitar picks of late
- my keyboard is an ergomech split lily58 with blank black keycaps and [durock pom piano switches](https://www.amazon.com/DUROCK-Switches-Keyboard-Performance-Mechanical/dp/B0CLJ8GN6F).
