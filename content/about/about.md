_my name is Jk and i build systems._

THIS SECTION IS A WIP AND IS PRESENTED AS-IS WITH NO GUARANTEES

### this blog

the best people i know write. technical skills only get you so far. i have bigger ambitions.

posts here are usually about the future of technology, building infrastructure systems, and privacy.

### about me

i work at the intersection of emerging technology and software, with an emphasis on infrastructure, privacy, and AR/VR.

i'm currently building production systems at <a href="https://mystenlabs.com" target="_blank">mysten labs</a>. i work on <a href="https://blog.sui.io/zklogin-salt-server-architecture/" target="_blank">zklogin</a>, the most widely used zero knowledge system on earth. i also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQwpC02CQ9k" target="_blank">spoke on some of my work building reliable infrastructure fast at pulumi up 2024</a>

i was a production engineer at meta for a few years, working on privacy infrastructure and AR/VR. before that, i was at Arizona State University in <a href="http://meteor.ame.asu.edu" target="_blank">meteor studio</a> working on new research in augmented reality security and privacy.

software will define the future of humanity, and my strongest desire is to leave a legacy of software i built that my family can be proud of.

### tidbits

- my approach to my work includes a conviction that taste and curation will drive the next generation of technologies.
- i have a daughter who lights up my world. i subscribe to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia_approach" target="_blank">reggio emilia</a> approach the best i can in my parenting.
- rock and roll has always been a huge part of my life and recently i've gotten into an amalgamation of metal and hardcore appropriately called metalcore. most \*core music contains lyrical themes and sounds i can find joy in. angry music, happy boi.
- much like murakami, i began training for endurance athletics near the end of my twenties. i enjoy running long distance wherever i am and participate in the occasional race.
- when i was a teeenager i was an avid boy scout and earned the eagle scout award, taking many backpacking trips mostly around arizona. spending time in nature and making space for my family to do the same is a high priority for me.

#### life priorities

- family
- kindness
- health
- legacy
- passion
- ambition

#### things

i generally try to live minimally and avoid accumulation of things when possible, prioritizing owning a few high-quality things.

- you will find me wearing mostly black most of the year. i thoroughly enjoy the variety of styles that exist within a single color. this is an outward expression of my belief that <a href="https://x.com/after_ephemera/status/1968102054750302227" target="_blank">constraint yields creativity</a> and lends itself well to a minimalistic wardrobe.
- i almost exclusively run long distance in <a href="https://www.altrarunning.com/en-us/all-shoes?gad_campaignid=21768670950&gbraid=0AAAAADm0swc4KpS9FqbleaF7gl-Rah52v" target="_blank">altras</a>. i am accustomed the luxury of running zero-drop and with a wide toebox. the foot strength, comfort, and road-closeness are well worth the premium price.
- inside my home i wear my <a href="https://mahabis.com/products/curve-slippers" target="_blank">mahabis curve</a> shoes, which provide a balance between comfort and support, especially when working from home.
- i have a single <a href="https://www.globalcutleryusa.com/chef-knife-7-5-40th-anniv-g-78-ab" target="_blank">global chef knife</a> that has treated me well but is showing signs of incessant use.
- the <a href="https://www.jimdunlop.com/jazz-iii-pick-variety-pack-6-pack/" target="_blank">dunlop tortex jazz iii </a> have been my chosen guitar picks of late. ernie ball's <a href="https://www.ernieball.com/earthwood" target="_blank">earthwood series</a> are the strings i equip my acoustic with.
- my keyboard is an ergomech split lily58 with blank black keycaps and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DUROCK-Switches-Keyboard-Performance-Mechanical/dp/B0CLJ8GN6F" target="_blank">durock pom piano switches</a>.
- sunday tends to be pizza night in our house, and i bake 16 inch pies on a 3/8 inch pizza steel. the factory seconds ones are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFBBK9VF" target="_blank">relatively affordable</a> compared to the bigger home pizza ovens and result in some solid pizzas.

#### music

some of the artists i keep coming back to are

- four year strong
- the devil wears prada
- we came as romans
- bilmuri
- mighty oaks
- joan
- lany

my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7KvLWWRsq6MJ8Dcgi5Tktt?si=9553c15b6c374a55" target="_blank">"can you dig it?" playlist</a> is where i rotate through new music quite regularly and is a good reference point for up to date sonic obsessions.

### anti-favorites:

- haskell
- quiet resentment
- phone cases

### religion:

i was raised as a latter day saint. i have been in a decade-long process of introspection and expect to be discovering my own faith for the rest of my life. high-control religion is hurtful and tends to be overtly regressive, but i believe there is immense value in the ritual, prayer, loyalty, hope, faith, inner strength, and community of organized religion.

### reach out

i can be reached fairly easily at all the usual places like <a href="https://twitter.com/after_ephemera" target="_blank">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lovedonesandzeros" target="_blank">messenger</a>.
