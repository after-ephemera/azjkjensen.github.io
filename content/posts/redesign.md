# redesign

I decided to move into the modern age, abandon [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (and Ruby for that matter, yuck), and redo my blog on a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site. It was the right move and it was overdue. I despise Ruby and maintaining a Ruby toolchain is a pain on MacOS. So here it is! 

Hopefully I'll integrate some subscription mechanism as well soon.

Will it inspire me to do more writing? Only time will tell...
