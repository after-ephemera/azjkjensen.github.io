My wife and I participated in one of those "what are your core values" exercises a few months back. The values I landed on being my top three were "Family, "Respect," and "ambition." 

## Family

- moving
- taking Delsie days

## Respect for body, respect for self

- taking time to work out
- facing my conflicts, working through them, jetty 

## Ambition

- i'm just getting started
- mysten and the future of the internet
- privacy and policing tooling
