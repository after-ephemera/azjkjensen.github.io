### this blog

the best people i know write. technical skills only get you so far. i have bigger ambitions.

### about me

i'm currently building production systems at [mysten labs](https://mystenlabs.com){:target="\_blank"}.

i was a production engineer at meta for a few years, working on privacy infrastructure and AR/VR. before that, i was at Arizona State University in [meteor studio](http://meteor.ame.asu.edu/){:target="\_blank"} working on new research in augmented reality security and privacy.

i know software will define much of the future of humanity, and my strongest desire is to leave a legacy my family can be proud of. outside of work i read and bake.
