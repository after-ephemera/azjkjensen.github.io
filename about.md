_Hello. My name is Jk and I build systems._

### this blog

This blog is intended to be a place to store my thoughts. Topics open for discussion include (but are not limited to) programming, literature, hamburger menus, privilege, family, hiking, music production, finance, engineering, and Oxford Commas. But I'll mostly stick to technical topics like systems and programming. [My wife](http://whilebeinginlove.blogspot.com){:target="_blank"}, on the other hand, is a talented logophile and I respect the ability she has to express feeling through her words.

### about me

I am a computer engineer working at Arizona State University in the [information networks group](http://informationnet.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My work is centered on mobile systems and fog networking. This summer I will be at Facebook as an intern in production engineering. 

I know software will define much of the future of humanity, and my strongest desire is to leave a legacy my family can be proud of.
